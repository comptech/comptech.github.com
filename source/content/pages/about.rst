About COMPRES
-------------
`COMPRES <http://compres.us>`_, the Consortium for Materials Properties Research in Earth Sciences is a community-based consortium whose goal is to enable Earth Science researchers to conduct the next generation of high-pressure science on world-class equipment and facilities. It facilitates the operation of beam lines, the development of new technologies for high pressure research, and advocates for science and educational programs to the various funding agencies.

About COMPTECH
--------------
The mission of `COMPRES <http://compres.us>`_ is driven by its science goals, but it is mainly the experimental technology available at central facilities such as synchrotron beamlines, that enables this science. Argonne National Laboratory's synchrotron source, the Advanced Photon Source (APS) is currently the leading central facility for synchrotron science in the United States. With its storage ring operating at 7 GeV electron energy, the experimental stations at APS offer a significantly higher flux of hard x-rays (above 20 keV), which are most suitable for high-pressure experiments, than other synchrotron sources in the country. APS beamlines are heavily utilized by members of the `COMPRES <http://compres.us>`_ community to carry out their research. APS is currently in the initial stage of a major midterm upgrade which will significantly boost the current capabilities and increase the amount of beam time available to users. This will be done by canting most of the existing insertion devices and creating new experimental stations.

Since its inception, `COMPRES <http://compres.us>`_ has maintained its presence at APS by funding Infrastructure Development projects located at high-pressure beamlines (Sectors 3, 13, 16). Many of these projects have been very successful and have had a significant impact on the `COMPRES <http://compres.us>`_ community and their research output, as well as on the APS itself. `COMPRES <http://compres.us>`_ Technology Center (COMPTECH) at Argonne is established to realize the main mission to initiate, facilitate and coordinate new Partner User Proposals to create new capabilities and preferential access to state-of-the art facilities at existing beamlies at Advanced Photon Source for the `COMPRES <http://compres.us>`_ community.

The location of the COMPTECH at the Argonne Laboratory brings several significant advantages: (i) as the most advanced hard X-ray synchrotron source in the country APS hosts a variety on unique, state of the art instruments and engages in development of novel forefront experimental technology (ii) ANL hosts several of the current `COMPRES <http://compres.us>`_ projects and there are on-going plans to establish more permanent `COMPRES <http://compres.us>`_ facilities though PUP proposals; (iii) ANL also hosts a lot of resident experts on experimental technology, software and methods development, as well as a whole spectrum of high-pressure researchers, who will be interested in collaborating with the COMPTECH, (iv) the lab is within driving distance from the `COMPRES <http://compres.us>`_ headquarters at Urbana and in close proximity to two major airports; (v) it is located at a central research facility frequently visited by the majority of active `COMPRES <http://compres.us>`_ members, which should allow and stimulate collaborations.
