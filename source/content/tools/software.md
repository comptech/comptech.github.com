### XRD Data Analysis and Interpretation
- [FIT2D](http://www.esrf.eu/computing/scientific/FIT2D/), a general purpose and specialist 1 and 2 dimensional data analysis program. (_by A. Hammersley_)
    - [Manual](http://www.esrf.eu/computing/scientific/FIT2D/FIT2D_REF/fit2d_r.html)
	- [Download](http://ftp.esrf.eu/pub/expg/FIT2D/), available for Mac, Linux, and Windows
- [BEARTEX](http://eps.berkeley.edu/~wenk/TexturePage/beartex.htm), the Berkeley Texture Package, provides a set of over 35 programs running under _Windows_ environment to analyze preferred orientation in polycrystalline materials (by _Ruby Wenk_).
- [Maud](http://www.ing.unitn.it/~maud/), Materials Analysis Using Diffraction. It is a general diffraction/reflectivity analysis program mainly based on the Rietveld method, but not limited to.
- [CrystalSleuth](http://rruff.info/about/about_software.php) is capable of analyzing and manipulating both Raman and powder diffraction data sets. 
- [XtalDraw](http://rruff.info/about/about_download.php) is interactive Windows-based software that draws crystal and molecular structures as ball and stick, polyhedral, and thermal ellipsoid representations.
- [HPDiff](http://merkel.zoneo.net/HPDiff/) simulates composite diffraction patterns of materials under high pressure.
- [GSE_ADA/RSV](https://sites.google.com/site/gseadawiki/home), single crystal x-ray diffraction package (_by Przemek Dera_)
- [GSE_shell](https://sites.google.com/site/gseshellwiki/), is a GUI (Graphical User Interface) driven program developed at  GeoSoilEnviro CARS to help researchers collecting x-ray diffraction data at the synchrotron in quick preliminary evaluation and simple analysis of their experimental results.  (_by Przemek Dera_)
- [FitEoS](https://sites.google.com/site/liligao2/software/fiteos), can be used to fit compression data with various equation of states. (_by Lili Gao_)
- [PressureScale](https://sites.google.com/site/liligao2/software/pressure-scale) can be used to calculate pressure from equation of state. (_by Lili Gao_)
- [GSAS-2](https://subversion.xor.aps.anl.gov/trac/pyGSAS)
- [VESTA](http://jp-minerals.org/vesta/en/), structure visualization and electron density modeling
- [University of Bari crystallographic software](http://wwwba.ic.cnr.it/content/software), structure solution and refinement for powder and single crystal
- [ShelX](http://shelx.uni-ac.gwdg.de/SHELX/), crystal structure refinement
- [PowderCell](http://www.ccp14.ac.uk/ccp/web-mirrors/powdcell/a_v/v_1/powder/e_cell.html), for powder diffraction, great for group-subgroup relation analysis
- [Powder3d](http://www2.fkf.mpg.de/xray/html/powder3D.html), very useful program for powder analysis and Refinement
- [WinGX](http://www.chem.gla.ac.uk/~louis/software/wingx/index.html), shell for single crystal crystallographic analysis
- [Fox](http://vincefn.net/Fox/), structure solution from powder diffraction
- [Fullprof](http://www.ill.eu/sites/fullprof/), alternative to GSAS
- [DiffPy](http://www.diffpy.org/), great tools for pair distribution function analysis
- [Fable](http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/fable), multigrain single-crystal analysis
- [Rietan](http://www.ccp14.ac.uk/ccp/web-mirrors/rietan/fujioizumi/rietan/angle_dispersive/angle_dispersive.html), pattern fitting and Rietveld refinement
- [USPEX](http://mysbfiles.stonybrook.edu/~aoganov/USPEX.html), is a method developed jointly by Artem R. Oganov, Andriy O. Lyakhov, Colin W. Glass and Qiang Zhu, and implemented in the same-name code written by Andriy O. Lyakhov, Colin W. Glass and Qiang Zhu. This method/code enables crystal structure prediction at arbitrary P-T conditions, given just the chemical composition of the material.
- [CrystalCracker](http://multianvil.asu.edu/Crystal_Cracker/CrystalCracker.html) (_by Kurt Leinenweber_)
- [Ross Angel's softwares](http://www.rossangel.com/home.htm)
- [FitYK](http://fityk.nieto.pl/), peak fitting program.
- [MINUTI](http://www.nrixs.com): A scientific application for: calculation and fitting of experimental p-V-T data to a thermal and/or spin equation of state; calculation of sound velocities including spatial averages from elastic constants; calculation and fitting of melting spectra from nuclear resonant forward scattering. (_by Wolfgang Sturhahn_)

### Pressure determination
